# Asthma_no2_urban
Output files for the study of long term trends of NO2 attributable asthma cases i urban areas during 2000-2019 period.
Files are stored in the /data/ directory.
List of available files:
  1- Urban_asthma_exposure_desc: This files includes the results of control scenario for all urban areas including the spatially averaged concentration of NO2, population weighted average concentration of NO2, and estimated asthma cases attributed to NO2.
  2- This file includes results of concentrations and estimated asthma cases for urban/non-urban areas, aggregated by GBD defined regions and super regions.
  3- Scenarios_contribution: Similair to "Urban_asthma_exposure_desc" file, but these are the results of scenarios calculated for evaluating the contribution of concentration, population, and asthma baseline rates to estimated asthma count difference between each year and base year (2000). In each scenario, one of the three aforementioned parameters are replaced with their base year (2000) value.
